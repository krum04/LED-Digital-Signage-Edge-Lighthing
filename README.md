# LED Digital Signage Edge Lighting
This code is an add on to a Raspberry Pi Digital Signage Solution. 

The script will analyze the photo in the slide show and take a sample average of the edges of the image save them as RGB values. These values will be passed to NeoPixels mounted on the rear of the signs controlled through the Rapsberry Pi's GPIO pins.
